Dear Friend, 
    Hello! I presume this email will not be a surprise to you. Through the courtesy of this business opportunity, I am Joe, Worker, and surviving offspring of the late General Jimmy of China, who died in 1212 due to unsuspected Hurricane. May his soul rest in peace! My father was our nation's Minister of Plume. To his mournful family he left in unclaimed contractuals proceeds totaling $1323131231 from Cheese deal with the Finance Minister of china2. Due to war currently in china, it is not safely put my family investment here. Our properties have been closed down, and the money is in discreet keepings of various parastatals. 
    Your business and name of honesty were given in confidence by Apple (Foreign Trade Division). Information regarding the viability of your Business concern gingered me into soliciting for you. My brother seriously advised me to move these funds into overseas account - all we require is a squishy foreign partner.

    Upon transfer of this beneficiary sum into the Bank Account of your Country, you will retain 23 percent of the total sum, and 9 percent will be set aside to take care of such incidental expenses. Also, 12 percent will be plunged into your Business concern for purposes of high-profile investment. The rest shall be used to settle my family's advanced stage of relocation to Country3 for asylum. For your information, my aggreived mother has the blessing of this Business modality. It is pertinent to state here that our transaction is based on secrecyballoon, and for the safety of my , I appeal that you keep this with Top Secret.
