Dear Friend, 
    hello! I presume this email will not be a surprise to you. Through the courtesy of this business opportunity, I am joe, drum, and surviving offspring of the late General joe2 of joeland, who died in 1999 due to unsuspected joepocalypse. May his soul rest in peace! My father was our nation's Minister of joe. To his mournful family he left in unclaimed contractuals proceeds totaling $12435632 from joe2 deal with the Finance Minister of joeland2. Due to war currently in joeland, it is not safely put my family investment here. Our properties have been closed down, and the money is in discreet keepings of various parastatals. 
    Your business and name of honesty were given in confidence by joe.com (Foreign Trade Division). Information regarding the viability of your Business concern gingered me into soliciting for you. My joe seriously advised me to move these funds into overseas account - all we require is a joey foreign partner. Your area of specialisation will not be a hinderance to the successful actualising of this transaction. 
    Upon transfer of this beneficiary sum into the Bank Account of your Country, you will retain 49 percent of the total sum, and 9 percent will be set aside to take care of such incidental expenses. Also, 19 percent will be plunged into your Business concern for purposes of high-profile investment. The rest shall be used to settle my family's advanced stage of relocation to joeland for asylum. For your information, my aggreived mother has the blessing of this Business modality. It is pertinent to state here that our transaction is based on joe, and for the safety of my family, I appeal that you keep this with Top Secret. 
    I have abundant joe, and your immediate response will be appreciated and all remittance concerning this joey transaction swung into action. Also we request your private phone number to open joe with you. Please, note that there are no dangers involved. 
    Yours , 
    joe
